Data Used

For this script i used the following data sets:
- activity_labels.txt
- features.txt
- subject_test.txt
- X_test.txt
- y_test.txt
- subject_train.txt
- X_train.txt
- y_train.txt

Packages needed:

data.table and reshape2

Steps performed

The assignment calls for the steps to be performed in this order:

## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
## From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of
each variable for each activity and each subject

However i conducted the steps slightly out of order choosing instead to deal with the train and test data sets separately and then 
merge them as a last step.

The first 11 lines of code actually load the files via the read.table function

I then read in the second column of the "features" using grepl to only focus on "mean" and "std".
I then save new version of the X_train and X_test data adding a column for the extracted features.
I then label the subject and "y" train test data with the appropriate labels and repeat the same for the "test" versions of the same 
data.

Now it's time to merge all of the data and i do this twice using the cbind function, although this can potentially be done in a single s
step.

With setdiff i identify the columns in data that are not my assigned labels. This allows me to name all of those using the melt
function for merging all of the columns and their labels together.

The final steps are to fulfill the requirement for #4 of the project. Dcast lets me widen the data frame with the desired labels 
over the previously melted data.
